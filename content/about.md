# Welcome
## About Me
I am a DevOps Engineer with ten years of technical experience in Linux systems administration, network management, and cloud architecture. I hold a certificate in Cybersecurity from the University of Texasâ€™s Bootcamp. I am skilled in automation (SALT, Ansible), scripting in Python and Bash, and corporate compliance. Has implemented ground-up infrastructure monitoring at two companies, implemented open-source host management solution via Proxmox, and has deployed and managed CI/CD via Jenkins and Kubernetes. My strengths in project management and planning and my expertise in Linux administration make me an excellent addition to any technical team.

I am a writer, reader, guitarist, and runner. I enjoy traveling with my wife and dog.
